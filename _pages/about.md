I am a Ph.D. candidate in Control Science and Engineering at the Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, [School of Astronautics](https://sa.hit.edu.cn/), Harbin Institute of Technology ([HIT](https://www.hit.edu.cn/)), Harbin, China.

My research interest includes on computational optical imaging, image restoration and enhancement, computer vision, and deep learning. To date, I have authored or co-authored ~30 publications across journals and conferences. I am open to research collaborations.
